    <p> I have recently returned to BYU-I. The last time I attended was in 2018. 
    <p>My husband and I decided to move to rexburg so that I can finish school. My major is web desing and development</p>
    <p> I love to read and dance and I really enjoy baking and cooking. My favorite things to bake are cookies and cupcakes.</p>
